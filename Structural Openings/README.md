APIIntersections

> this nodes works with three inputs: Revit floor elements and min and max points for bounding boxes

> points are obtained from bounding boxes geometry of selected linked elements

> it is using the API to extraxct each floor's uppermost face, build solids from the min and max points and detech intersections' geometry directly in the API

> it returns uppermost planar faces of all intersections found, as well as their corresponding floor faces
